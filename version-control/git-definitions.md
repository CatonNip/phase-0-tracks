# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control records changes to files over time so you can always call on specific versions later. This is super useful in case you mess up on one version of a file you can go back to an older version of the file.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a new environment what you can use to text new things without intefering with your code on the main branch.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a function on git that you can call on that takes a file that was added to the stage and commits it into your desktop repository.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when you have two or more versions of a file that are on sperate branches.
