You may or may not know it but your devices are not secure. In this world we use so many digital platforms to advertise ourself and share the in and outs of our personal lives online that sometimes we forget that that information is vulnerable to people that would want to use it against us. My goal for this project is to learn why our information is vulnerable and create a program that will allow others to practice safe online procedures that will protect them. Wish me luck!
