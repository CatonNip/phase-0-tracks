####Pseudocode####
#Release 0 
#prompt the agent to input their name
#save that name into a data stucture 
#create small methods so you can link them together
#translate if a letter within the data structure is a vowel or consonant
#look up modual to transfer charaters and/or indexes of a data structure
#make all of the inputs .downcase or .upcase to filter though inputs that might have both

#I need to def methods that:
	#gathers the user's name and convert it to a data structure
	#tell me if an item on a data structure is a vowel
	#tell me if an item on a data stucture is a consonant
	#convert the user's original name into an alias 

#Vivi, start with this first and worry about the other stuff later. You got this!
