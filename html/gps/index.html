What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
	HTML5 semantic tags are created for one to clearly understand the meaning of an element. All of the ones we went over today where super useful but I'll be using <main>,<section>, <header>, <footer>, and <nav> the most.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
	Header, nav, section, article, aside, then footer.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
	Sublime lets you snippets which are templates that you might use often. Currently I don't see myself making anymore snippets as I want to practice writting things out the old fashion way.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
	The hardest concept to grasp was where to put each element for easy readability. Formating is an important part of maintaining proper workflow that I value. My guide gave me the proper way of formating which is easy to understand and read. In the future i'll be implementing this new formating process into my code.
